This 8-week intensive internship, running from June 5 to July 28, aims to prepare the interns to equip them with skills and understanding of electronic hardware design, fabrication, and security.<br /><br />The program, sponsored by Intel, is designed to train students for future jobs in Intel's upcoming Ohio chip factory, projected to be operational in 2025. The curriculum includes five courses that involve daily lectures and extensive hands-on lab practice. After a rigorous application process, 20 promising students were selected from CSU, Wright State University, Stark State College, Sinclair Community College, and local high schools from a very competitive pool of applicants.<br /><br />Dr. Hadizadeh, the CSU-Intel project director, expressed tremendous excitement for the internship launch and the exceptional opportunity it offers the selected interns. "We are incredibly excited to kick off this internship program," said Dr. Hadizadeh. "It's an opportunity to contribute to diversity, equity, and inclusion in the semiconductor field, which we're highly proud of. This is our initial yet another significant step towards training our practical skills in the semiconductor industry." Dr. Hadizadeh also expressed gratitude to Intel for their generous support and sponsorship of the Intel Semiconductor Education Program at CSU and to the Wright State University team for hosting and providing the ideal setting for this transformative educational experience, and CSU-Intel team for their diligent efforts in coordinating this summer internship.<br /><br />Dr. Morakinyo Kuti, Associate Provost for Research at CSU, mentioned, "This effort represents how a public-private partnership can address societal concerns. The partnership between public institutions of higher education and Intel addresses the national security and economic security concerns for the USA to produce semiconductors domestically through an inclusive and diversified workforce."<br /><br />Dr. Ajayi-Majebi, Professor of MFE, noted the considerable interest received from female and underrepresented student communities across various Ohio institutes. "This encouraging response is a strong indicator of the potential for future expansion in Semiconductor Education and Research at CSU for skilled-workforce development in the great State of Ohio. I believe that the interning students are on track to secure high upward mobility careers in the cutting-edge semiconductor technology field, with great salaries, benefits and working conditions," stated Dr. Ajayi-Majebi.<br /><br />Dr. Abdallah, who chairs the MFE department, elaborated on the state of semiconductor education at Central State University, stated: "Under the active leadership of Dr. Hadizadeh within our semiconductor program, we're making considerable progress in establishing a semiconductor simulation lab and a microfabrication lab right here at CSU." Looking toward the future, Dr. Abdallah shared his optimistic projection about the internship program. "By next summer, with Intel's sustained support, we anticipate being well-equipped to host the internship program right here on our campus. This development would also potentially enable us to expand the number of interns in the program."<br /><br />Dr. Mubbashar Khan, a Research Assistant Professor at CSU, stated that "The internship program is the demonstration of the commitment of CSU and Intel towards achieving diversity in skilled workforce development in the semiconductor domain. The internship program and continued support from Intel will help in developing student interest in STEM fields, especially in the semiconductor domain."<br /><br />As we embark on the Intel-Sponsored Summer Internship, we look forward to the innovative and impactful contributions some of these interns who choose to pursue a career with Intel will bring to the semiconductor industry.<br /><br /></span><img class="imageStyle" alt="CSU_Intel_summer_internship_kickoff_12" src="files/csu_intel_summer_internship_kickoff_12.jpeg" width="1000" height="667" /><img class="imageStyle" alt="CSU_Intel_summer_internship_kickoff_1" src="files/csu_intel_summer_internship_kickoff_1.jpeg" width="1000" height="667" /><img class="imageStyle" alt="CSU_Intel_summer_internship_kickoff_5" src="files/csu_intel_summer_internship_kickoff_5.jpeg" width="1000" height="667" /><img class="imageStyle" alt="CSU_Intel_summer_internship_kickoff_17" src="files/csu_intel_summer_internship_kickoff_17.jpeg" width="1000" height="667" /><img class="imageStyle" alt="CSU_Intel_summer_internship_kickoff_8" src="files/csu_intel_summer_internship_kickoff_8.jpeg" width="1000" height="404" /><img class="imageStyle" alt="CSU_Intel_summer_internship_kickoff_2" src="files/csu_intel_summer_internship_kickoff_2.jpeg" width="1000" height="667" /><img class="imageStyle" alt="CSU_Intel_summer_internship_kickoff_23" src="files/csu_intel_summer_internship_kickoff_23.jpeg" width="1000" height="667" /><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;"><br /><br /></span></p></div></div><div id="unique-entry-id-11" class="blog-entry"><h1 class="blog-entry-title"><a href="files/Intel_summer_internship_2023.html" class="blog-permalink">Paid Intel Summer Internship​ for Women and Underrepresented Minorities</a></h1><div class="blog-entry-date">13/04/23 14:37 </div><div class="blog-entry-body"><p style="text-align:center;"><img class="imageStyle" alt="Paid_Intel_Summer_Intership_2023_Flyer" src="files/paid_intel_summer_intership_2023_flyer.png" width="527" height="684" /><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;"><br /></span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:16px; color:#7F007F;font-weight:bold; ">Are you seeking an exceptional opportunity to jump-start your career at Intel?</span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;"><br />Central State University, in partnership with Intel and Wright State University (WSU), is delighted to offer the Intel-Sponsored Summer Internship Program, specifically tailored for undergraduate and high-school students from female and underrepresented minority backgrounds.<br /></span></p><p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:16px; color:#7F007F;font-weight:bold; ">Program Details:</span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;"> <br /></span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;"><a href="../resources/Paid_Intel_Summer_Intership_2023_Flyer.pdf" target="_blank">Duration</a></span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;">: June 5 - July 28 (8 weeks) <br />Location: Wright State University Campus <br />Open to all students (basic high-school mathematics required) <br />+++<br /></span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#7F007F;font-weight:bold; ">Scholarship Benefits:</span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;"> <br />$5,000 stipend and food allowance <br />Paid accommodation at WSU guest houses <br />+++<br /></span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#7F007F;font-weight:bold; ">Online Application (by May 12, 2023):</span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;"> <br /></span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;"><a href="https://shorturl.at/xN024" target="_blank">https://shorturl.at/xN024</a></span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;"> <br />+++<br /></span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#7F007F;font-weight:bold; ">Internship Curriculum:</span><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;"> <br />Introduction to Microelectronics Design (June 5 - 16) <br />Introduction to Microelectronics Security (June 19 - 30) <br />Introduction to Printed Circuit Board Fabrication and Design (July 3 - 14) <br />Introduction to Microelectronics Fabrication (July 17 - 21) <br />Additive Microfabrication of Electronics (July 24 - 28) <br />+++<br /></span></p><p style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:16px; color:#0C0D14;">The program's goal is to train students in electronic hardware design, fabrication, and security, equipping them for future Intel job opportunities in Ohio.
